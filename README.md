# Sorting_algorithms

The program is designed to test four different algorithms for sorting tasks: First Come First Serve (FCFS), Last Come First Serve (LCFS), Least Recently Used (LRU), and Least Frequently Used (LFU). Two different types of sorting tasks are performed: process sorting and page sorting.

For the process sorting task, the program generates processes using a function that takes in the standard deviation of arrival times and execution times, the number of processes, the mean execution time, and the mean arrival time. The program then sorts the processes using the FCFS and LCFS algorithms, and calculates the average waiting time and average turnaround time for each algorithm. The results are then exported to a CSV file that can be used to create charts and graphs to visualize the performance of each algorithm.

For the page sorting task, the program generates pages using the same function used for the process sorting task. The program then sorts the pages using the LRU and LFU algorithms, and calculates the final state of the cache and the hit rate for each algorithm. The results are exported to a CSV file that can be used to create charts and graphs to visualize the performance of each algorithm.

Overall, this program provides a comprehensive testing process for four different sorting algorithms, providing insight into the efficiency and effectiveness of each algorithm. The use of CSV files and charts makes it easy to interpret the results and compare the performance of each algorithm.
